##Introduction
I am currently taking part in a basketball league called X-League and found the current website lacking. Thus, utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Ruby on Rails, the new and improved X-League web application will take the original website [www.xleaguenation.org](www.xleaguenation.org) to the next level. The current website simply portrays the stats per game; however, the web application will manipulate the data to have a more interactive experience so that users will be able to look up individual players and teams and find per game stats as well as season totals all in a single page. The ultimate goal will be to bring about another level of competition through statistics among the players.

##The App
The application will allow users to view stats based on the team or player. In addition, if the user signs in, he will be able to set a favorite player to be portrayed on the home page after being signed in. Therefore, the user will no longer have to navigate through the players page and search for his player.

The X-League commissioner will have the sole admin status to be able to create, update and delete information.
