#Project 2: X-League

##Description
Utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails, the X-League web application will take the original website [www.xleaguenation.org](www.xleaguenation.org) to the next level. The current website simply portrays the stats per game; however, the web application will manipulate the data to show not just the stats but also the season's current points/assists/rebounds/etc. leaders. In addition, users will be able to look up individual player's names and find per game stats as well as season averages all in a single page. The ultimate goal will be to bring about another level of competition through statistics among the players.
